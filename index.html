<p>10/24/22 Last week i worked on a rocket with the team i was on with Lyza, Daniel and
myself. The rocket we built took around 3 days to build but on friday we were gonna launch 
our rocket but we had a small hole so it couldn't be shot up into the air, 
so Mr. Poole told us to use a new bottle and my team and I created and new rocket
with a new bottle in around 30 mins which was pertty good.Next week i wanna do something
just as fun as it was this week.</p>

<p>11/4/22 This week we learned about electrical engineering and is something we are going to 
learn for the next 2 weeks which seems fun. This will probably be fun because it can 
show us how things work. We also can finally work with electricity which can be fun.
Next week i hope to start working on the real breadboard which will be fun.Also next week I hope
to get a good parnter for the bread board and one that does stuff, but I also hope its someone
I'm confortable with.</p>
