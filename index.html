the inside of computer. On The second day of dissecting the computer my partner

<p>10/14/22 This week we learned about arospace engineering. Things i learned 
the four things about arospace.(Drag,weight,thurst,lift). This week we also were
able to draw out and sketch our rocket for out project in this subject.
After we finished sketching out our project we were able to design it in tinkercad.</p>

<p>10/24/22 Last week i worked on a rocket with the team i was on with Lyza, Daniel and
myself. The rocket we built took around 3 days to build but on friday we were gonna launch 
our rocket but we had a small hole so it couldn't be shot up into the air, 
so Mr. Poole told us to use a new bottle and my team and I created and new rocket
with a new bottle in around 30 mins which was pertty good.Next week i wanna do something
just as fun as it was this week.</p>

<p>11/4/22 This week we learned about electrical engineering and is something we are going to 
learn for the next 2 weeks which seems fun. This will probably be fun because it can 
show us how things work. We also can finally work with electricity which can be fun.
Next week i hope to start working on the real breadboard which will be fun.Also next week I hope
to get a good parnter for the bread board and one that does stuff, but I also hope its someone
I'm confortable with. Next week i know that we are going to code the bread broad i think
but thats probably gonna be fun.</p>

<P>11/10/22 This week we used bread boards which was fun to use and I was able to 
learn a lot from using them. I was able to learn how to use a muiltimeter and i 
was able to learn how to use it. It was fun using them. But to turn them on i had
to use my computers battery to use them. </P>

<p>12/2/22 This week we got put into groups to build a spaghetti bridge and I like
the group I'm in because they are good. But we can only use 20 pieces of spaghetti
and that makes it much harder and more difficult to build becuase we can only use a
certin amount and not as much as we want. Also next week my group and i are going
to start the foundation of the bridge.</p>

<p>1/16/23 The last time I updated was before winterbreak and we tested our
 spaghetti brigdes and it was a fun process of building it as i was able to build it with the 
people i like. I don't know how much my brigde held but i know it was more than it 
weighted.

During winter break I really didn't do much except gaming for most of the time.
I play on a ps4, and i played with friends for most of the time and i was really able 
to get a break from school which was good.

Last week i learned alot about buisness, which could be really helpful towards the 
future. I learned about how to business work and how to gain money from it too.
After that week we have to create a business presentation on why we should get money to 
sell a certin prodect of our choice, and we're in groups of 3 or 4 and i feel like my presentation 
isn't that good as my team says we are just going to talk for most of the time then letting 
our slides to do most of the work so, I'm not to confident in my slides.</p>

<p>1/19/20 This week we learned about business and we had to create a 
presentation and we had to think about what products we can create a presentation on 
so we can get some offers for our companies. The offer that my group got was not that good. 
I forgot what offer we got but it was not that god.</p>

<p>1/27/23 This week we learned about different viscosity and we went over a 
presentation on it. After we created oobleck the next day it was pretty easy and
 fun to create it but it was messy. I also learned that when oobleck is punch it 
 acts like a solid but when you slower put you finger in it it feels like a 
 liquid.</p>

<p>2/3/23 This week we tinker cadded our mouse trap car and it was going good.
Tuesday we did the same thing but i was able to make the body and Niro almost finished the 
mouse trap for the car. On Wednesday i thought it was going to be a boring day, and i wasn't 
looking forward to math because I don't do anything in that class except copying 
notes, but after P.E, i went on to my fourth period. When i reach fourth period, it was 
going on as usual and then while in the middle of class we went into lock down. I 
soon find out that a guy came into the school to use the wifi. He left before school started
 and arrested at starbucks. And today(friday) he was arrested again for taking pictures
 of girls in a coffe shop. The sticky note challenge was on wednesday, i didn't take 
 any pictures of the sticky notes. </p>

 <p>3/24/2023 This week we worked on our egg drop contest and it was fun as we are going
 to test it next week.</p>
 
 <img src="egg.jpg"width="300"hieght="300">
 
 <P>3/31/2023 This week we tested the egg and it worked but we change the way it works kinda,
 because Niro Broke the one we were going to use but he throw it up and it broke the parachute.
 Becuase he broke it, it was able to work and it was more effective.</P>

 <P>4/7/2023 This week i worked on the boat project and it was fun and I may have to finish it next week because im not 
 sure if its down or not. I may have to work on it a little be more.</P>
 
 <img src="boat.png"width="300"hieght="300">
 
 <P>4/14/23 This week i was able to fully finish the cad and and i was able to start building the boat. The boat that I am building is going to
 look like a cardboard canoe but not as good. We are making the boat because we are trying
 we are going to row the boat on water and try to get as many laps as possible.</P>

 <P>4/28/23 This week we did contiuned to build my boat with my group and we made a good amount of progress and 
 we built the bottom of the boat but realies that it would be better to take it off and just layer the bottom of the boat with cardboard.
 It would be much more effective then what we were origanlly gonna do.Also we are just building the prototype and the real one is going to be built after.
